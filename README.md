# Next.js With Typescript Example Template

An example template made using [Next.js and Typescript](https://nextjs.org/docs) to start a new project. The template is setup with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started), [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/get-started) and [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).

## Why this template

I made this template because I have to set up every time Prettier, ESLint, StyleLint and Lint Staged for my new next.js projects. And I thought this might be useful for developers who are looking for configuration or starter or example templates.

## Before getting started

Make sure you have installed [Node.js 12.22.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple node version on your machine.

## Getting started

You can setup this project using npm or yarn package managers.

> I would recommend to installed or enabled [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started) package manager on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/binodnepali/nextjs-with-typescript-example-template.git
#or

```

### Navigate to cloned repo

#or

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
